                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            John grew up in Tyler, graduating from Robert E. Lee High School.  He left for Baylor upon graduation and there he met his wife Ashley.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After graduation, John and Ashley pursued opportunities both in and out of Texas.  Ultimately, family commitments and a desire to return home and open his own practice lead John and Ashley to come back to Tyler.  During the journey two beautiful daughters, both aspiring artists, came along.

                        <p>
                            There is also a resident mutt named Earl who keeps an eye on the whole crew.
